        <p>These guides serve as a good place to start. The grinder you use, coffee you choose, and yes, even the water from your sink, can alter the taste in the cup. Every machine is different, so youâ€™ll want to think of these parameters more as guidelines than law. Play around with your brewer and parameters to get each coffee to taste just how you like it.</p>
